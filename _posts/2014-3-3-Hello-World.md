title: A single seagull in a sea of seagulls!
---

There are a a lot of blogs out there... squawks from pretty well every self-proclainmed expert in every subject from gold fish to Mars missions, so here is one from this self-proclaimed expert on various subjects that I have dabbled, delved, dived and wallowed in over the past years (read decades) of my career in software and electronics technologies. 

Ok, ok I can hear it now... 'not another gray-hair dinosaur with stories of the early days of computing when 64k of memory was like a Klondike gold seam and micro-processor hexidecimal op-codes were commited to memory'. 

I'll try to keep that to a minimum and focus on more relevent information like JavaScript frameworks, Java/SpringBoot micro-services, Internet of Things (IOT), Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and general software achitecture philosophy.

The accompanying github site [temecom](https://github.com/temecom) includes samples and projects associated with my independent exploration on this 'Planet of the Geeks'. 

Enjoy, comment (politely please) and contribute (always welcome).
